Project:A Simple Calculator 

Objective: 
To create a simple Java console application that functions as a basic calculator. The application will prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), perform the selected operation, and display the result.

Features: 
1.User Input: The program will prompt the user to enter two numeric values.
2.Operation Selection: The user can choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) from a menu. 
3.Computation: The program will perform the selected arithmetic operation on the two input numbers. 
4.Result Display: The result of the computation will be displayed to the user. 
5.Error Handling: The program will handle division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message.

Key Activities: 
The project involves several key activities that ensure the calculator functions correctly and meets user expectations. 
These activities are essential for the successful completion and operation of the calculator.

Requirement Gathering Objective: 
1.Understand the needs and specifications for the calculator. Tasks: Determine the basic operations to include: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Decide on the user interface (console-based). Plan for input validation and error handling (e.g., division by zero).
2.Development Objective: Write the code to implement the calculator's functionality. Tasks: Set up the development environment (e.g., IDE or text editor). Implement code for taking user input using the Scanner class. Write the logic for performing arithmetic operations. Implement the switch-case structure for handling different operations. Include input validation and error handling. Ensure the program can gracefully handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values).

Summary: 
These key activities encompass the entire lifecycle of the basic calculator project, from initial planning and design to development, testing, and maintenance. By following these activities, you can ensure that the project is well-organized, functional, andÂ user-friendly.
